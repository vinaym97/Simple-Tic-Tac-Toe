"""Heads or Tails
We have tossed a coin 6 times and saved the results in a list called heads_or_tails. The values are integers: 1 stands for a head, while 0 denotes a tail.

Add some code to find out whether the list has any heads. Do not print the variable check, just store the result in it."""


# Fingers crossed
check = any(heads_or_tails)
